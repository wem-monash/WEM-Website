          <h3>Who are we?</h3>
          <p>
            Women in Engineering at Monash (WEM) is a student-run society that aims to inspire and support
            women-identifying students studying in STEM.
          </p>
          <p>
            Founded in 2012, the club has seen astonishing growth over time, with well over 300 members and support
            from 20 industry leading sponsors in 2025.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although events are primarily targeted towards the women-identifying minority, WEM values inclusivity and
            welcomes all STEM students to participate.

          <h3>What we do</h3>
          <p>
            WEM primarily seeks to empower women with a specific focus on creating a support network amongst peers and
            professionals alike.
          </p>
          <p>
          Furthermore, an emphasis is placed on providing the necessary resources to stay informed and develop
          confidence in order to facilitate a smooth transition from university into the workforce.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every year, WEM collaborates closely with sponsor companies, Monash University, and other student clubs to
            deliver our plethora of social, academic, industry and outreach events.
